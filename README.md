# Go Toolkit
A set of algorithms and data structures that are not part of the standard Go packages and that we need
on a daily basis.

## Algorithms
* **SliceStack**: backed by a growing slice. Contributed by @haveahennessy
* **Stack**: backed by a linked list. If you are too constrained by space, use SliceStack instead.
